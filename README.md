# Fraud Detection

Financial fraud is a major concern that leads to significant economic losses across various sectors such as banking, e-commerce, and insurance. Detecting fraudulent transactions is challenging due to the rarity of fraud cases compared to legitimate transactions and the evolving tactics used by fraudsters. In this project, we aim to develop a robust machine learning model that can accurately detect fraudulent transactions in a real-world setting.

## Prerequisites

* Git
* Python 3.8+ installed

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/stevenLeecode/fraudDetection.git
   cd fraudDetection
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment** (recommended)

   * On macOS/Linux:

     ```bash
     python3 -m venv venv
     ```

   * On Windows:

     ```powershell
     python -m venv venv
     ```

3. **Activate the virtual environment**

   * On macOS/Linux:

     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

   * On Windows (PowerShell):

     ```powershell
     .\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
     ```

4. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   pip install --upgrade pip
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Ensure the virtual environment is activated.

2. Run the main Python script:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
